# AI Cyber Threat Detection Using ANN

## Objective
Detect cyber threats using SIEM event logs and neural networks.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- SIEM Event Logs
- Neural Networks (ANN, CNN, LSTM)

## Dataset
Log-based event profiles simulating enterprise attacks.

## Features
- Event log normalization
- Threat classification using ANN
- 95% detection accuracy
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping

## How to Run
1. Install Python libraries
2. Run run.bat or python CyberThreatDetection.py
3. View detection results

## Results
Successfully detected simulated threats with high accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate Microsoft Sentinel
- Add real-time SIEM ingestion
- Improve false-positive reduction
